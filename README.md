# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regression

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the price of gold using historical data and various economic indicators. It employs the Random Forest Regression algorithm, a robust machine learning model that can handle complex relationships and interactions in data. Accurate predictions of gold prices can be useful for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generates new features based on existing data for better model accuracy.
- **Random Forest Regression Model:** Implements and trains a Random Forest Regression model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses various metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Provides plots to visualize the predicted vs. actual prices and feature importance.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gold-price-prediction.git
cd gold-price-prediction
```
